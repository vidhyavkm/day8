Map, Reduce , Filter
map()

map always takes a function as an argument.
this method is used for creating a new array.
it always returns a new array.
map doesnt change the length of the array
it works on each and every index or element of an array.

syntax:
let name = varname.map(function){return}
we can use any function , but for code simplification developers use arrow function.

filter:
if i want to extract some particular data from an array or array ogf objects , i can use filter
this is also takes a function as a parameter
this is also returns the elements from original array
filter will change the length of a array.
it works on each and every index or element of an array.
it should always have a condition


Reduce:
it helps to reduce the array into a single element.
this also takes function as a parameter
inside the function we have 2 parameters.
accumulator = initialvalue, currentvalue
it will works on each and every element in an array

case:1
if we dont give initialvalue

case2:
if i fix initialvalue , it will take last index as currentvalue.

foreach: (map)

it is also needs an array,
this is an alternative to for loop.
it is also takes function as a parameter.
apply on each and every element
it returns undefined.
we can use for each for getting output tin a sepearte line.

syntax: foreach(curr,index){

}
.foreach(num=>)
